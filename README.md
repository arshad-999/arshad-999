- 👋 Hi, I’m @arshad
- 👀 I'm interested in the future of AI in software testing! How can automation and machine learning further improve test coverage and efficiency?
- 🌱 I'm currently learning more about API testing frameworks. Expanding my skillset beyond UI automation is a big goal this year.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on open-source test automation projects. Building something cool with other testers would be a great learning experience.

- ⚡ Fun fact:  I once found a critical bug by noticing a pixel-perfect misalignment in a button on a website. Attention to detail is key!
